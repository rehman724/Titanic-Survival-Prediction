# Titanic Survival Prediction
# Project Description
This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on demographic characteristics. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts survival rates.
# Methodology
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
# Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the testing set, indicating that it can accurately predict the survival of passengers based on their characteristics.
# Code Organization
The code is organized into sections for data loading and preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and model export.
# Note
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The results should not be taken as a definitive prediction of survival, but rather as a demonstration of the power of machine learning in predicting outcomes based on available data.
